Problems:

Let Ω={1,2,3,4,5,6}\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
Ω={1,2,3,4,5,6} (a die roll).


Write down the smallest σ\sigma
σ-algebra that makes the event "roll is even" measurable.

Write down the smallest σ\sigma
σ-algebra that makes both "roll is even" and "roll ≤3\leq 3
≤3" measurable.

How many elements does each σ\sigma
σ-algebra have?



Prove that the intersection of any collection of σ\sigma
σ-algebras is itself a σ\sigma
σ-algebra. (This is why "smallest σ\sigma
σ-algebra containing X" is well-defined.)

In your own words (2–3 sentences), explain why σ\sigma
σ-algebras are necessary. Why not just allow any subset of Ω\Omega
Ω to be an event?


Answers:

1.  a. F = {phi(or zero), omega (the sample set), {2,4,6},{1,3,5}}
    b. A σ-algebra must be closed under complements, unions, and intersections. So you need:

    {2, 4, 6} and its complement {1, 3, 5}
    {1, 2, 3} and its complement {4, 5, 6}
    All intersections: {2, 4, 6} ∩ {1, 2, 3} = {2}
    All unions: {2, 4, 6} ∪ {1, 2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
    And so on...

    The full σ-algebra is:
    F={∅,Ω,{2,4,6},{1,3,5},{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{2},{1,3},{4,6},{1,3,4,5,6},{1,2,3,4,6},{1,3,4,6},{2,4,5,6},{2,5},{1,2,3,5}}

    *** Don't forget {2,5} ∩ {1,3,4,5,6} = {5}
    c. a has 4, b has 16 elements

2. They both contain the sample set, (closed under compliments) if A is a subset of F and F is sigma-algebra then the compliment of A is valid. If G is also sigma alegbra, then the compliment of A is also a subset of G. (closed under union) if the the union of A is a subset of F then F is sigma algebra, and similarly with G if A is subset of F then that is a sigma-algebra. The intersection satisfies all these axioms, thus is sigma-algebra.

3. Becuase if we go uncountable sample sizes, then assigning probabiltes becomes inconsistent and break counting additivity. Sample space, restrict us to nice sets to study.
